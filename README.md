# The project description
I am sending you a small task for you to prepare and return to me before we
proceed on the next step.
The attached JSON file contains some mock data of our products and categories.
Use the file and create a small project. Hereâ€™s some ideas:
1. Use the categories and products data to create a PLP (product listing page),
it is up to you to use any design or layout you want.
2. Use the promotional spots data provided to include promotion spots images
in the PLP. Take into account the positioning. A type key of 1x1 means the
promotion image has the same dimensions as one product in the PLP.
3. Use the categories data to create a main menu and a sidebar menu
4. Use the products data and create a PDP (product detail page) that shows
product's detail, variants and images.
For this project, we would like you to use Vue 3, Nuxt 3 (optional) as the frontend
framework. The design is up to you.
Try to achieve as many points as you can. Looking forward to your solution.

# product-listing-page-project
I have chosen to go with vue3 and pinia to make the project.
The time i have used on the project is 2 and a half day. I could have used more time on the project. 
But the project is a little task sendt to me, so I have to sendt the solution back to them.
